 *
 * This class is representing an entinity class. The entinity/grocery has a given quantity, price, name, expiry date and unit of measurement.
 *
 * The role of this class is to represent an entinity, more specificly a grocery. The class is holding the quantity, price,
 * name, expiration date and unit of measurement of a grocery.
 *
 * The field quantity is of the datatype float, because the quantity
 * of a grocery does not necessarily have to be a whole number. It is neither necessary to use the datatype double, because you do not
 * need the extra precision of double, in this usecase.
 *
 * The field price is of the datatype float, because the price
 * of a grocery does not necessarily have to be a whole number. It is neither necessary to use the datatype double, because you do not
 * need the extra precision of double, in this usecase.
 *
 * The field name is of the datatype String, because a name is usually multiple characters.
 *
 * The field expirationDate is of the type LocalDate. LocalDate is a Class that is used for implementing dates. It contains a lot of useful methods
 * for manipulating dates, comparing dates, setting dates etc. Using LocalDate rather than a String is better, because it gives more room for
 * comparing dates, and manipulating dates.
 *
 * The field unitOfMeasurement is of the type String. This is because you can choose units such as "kg, g, dl" Units can be more than one character,
 * hence why it does make more sense to use datatype String than datatype char.
